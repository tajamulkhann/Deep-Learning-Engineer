    "A low temperature results in extremely repetitive and predictable text, but where local structure is highly realistic: in particular, all words (a word being a local pattern of characters) are real English words. With higher temperatures, the generated text becomes more interesting, surprising, even creative; it may sometimes invent completely new words that sound somewhat plausible (such as \"eterned\" or \"troveration\"). With a high temperature, the local structure starts breaking down and most words look like semi-random strings of characters. Without a doubt, here 0.5 is the most interesting temperature for text generation in this specific setup. Always experiment with multiple sampling strategies!
