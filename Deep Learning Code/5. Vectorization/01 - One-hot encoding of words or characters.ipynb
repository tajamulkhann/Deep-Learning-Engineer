    "## One-hot encoding of words or characters\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding is **the most common, most basic way to turn a token into a vector** (already used in champetr 3 for [notebook 01](https://github.com/lucone83/deep-learning-with-python/blob/master/notebooks/chapter_03/01%20-%20Binary%20classifier.ipynb) and [02](https://github.com/lucone83/deep-learning-with-python/blob/master/notebooks/chapter_03/02%20-%20Multiclass%20classifier.ipynb)). \n",
    "It consists in:\n",
    "- associating a unique integer index to every word;\n",
    "- turning this integer index i into a binary vector of size _N_, the size of the vocabulary, that would be all-zeros except for the i-th entry, which would be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one-hot encoding can be done at the character level as well. To unambiguously drive home what one-hot encoding is and how to implement it, here are two toy examples of one-hot encoding: one for words, the other for characters."

    "#### Word-level one-hot encoding with hashing trick (toy example)\n",
    "\n",
    "A variant of one-hot encoding is the so-called \"_one-hot hashing trick_\", which can be used when the number of unique tokens in your vocabulary is too large to handle explicitly. Instead of explicitly assigning an index to each word and keeping a reference of these indices in a dictionary, one may **hash words into vectors of fixed size**. This is typically done with a very lightweight hashing function. The main advantage of this method is that it does away with maintaining an explicit word index, which saves memory and allows online encoding of the data (starting to generate token vectors right away, before having seen all of the available data). The one drawback of this method is that it is susceptible to \"hash collisions\": two different words may end up with the same hash, and subsequently any machine learning model looking at these hashes won't be able to tell the difference between these words. The likelihood of hash collisions decreases when the dimensionality of the hashing space is much larger than the total number of unique tokens being hashed."
