    "The core building block of neural networks is the \"layer\", a data-processing module which you can conceive as a \"filter\" for data. Some data comes in, and comes out in a more useful form. Precisely, layers extract representations out of the data fed into them -- hopefully representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of deep learning really consists of chaining together simple layers which will implement a form of progressive \"data distillation\". A deep learning model is like a sieve for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filters -- the \"layers\".\n",

The second (and last) layer is a 10-way \"softmax\" layer, which means it will return an array of 10 probability scores (summing to 1). Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.\n",
